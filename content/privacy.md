summary: Privacy policy for the Webpage Summarizer website and associated plugin
---

This website was built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a popular open-source tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient websites. The site incorporates the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, which provides a visually appealing and user-friendly design. Throughout the development process, the website took inspiration and received invaluable assistance from [Jesse Wei's](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod) fork of the website. Currently, the website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a reliable and free hosting platform that enables seamless deployment of static websites.

To provide insightful analytics and improve the user experience, this website utilizes Google Analytics, a widely used web analytics service. Google Analytics employs cookies, which are small text files stored on your device, to track and analyze various aspects of your interaction with the website. These cookies collect information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and pages visited. It is important to note that the data collected through Google Analytics is anonymized and aggregated, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individual users.

To learn more about the privacy practices of Google, its technologies, and how cookies are used, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Technologies](https://policies.google.com/technologies), and [How Google Uses Cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies). These resources provide comprehensive information on how Google handles and protects user data.

In addition to analytics, this website employs a cookie to remember your preferred theme (light or dark). This allows the site to maintain consistency in appearance and provide a personalized browsing experience based on your chosen theme.

While efforts have been made to ensure the privacy and security of user information, it is essential to acknowledge that there might be information collection practices employed by Hugo, PaperMod, and GitHub Pages that I am not aware of. These tools and platforms may have their own data collection mechanisms or features that could impact user privacy. However, beyond the explicitly mentioned information and any undisclosed data collection, no other personal information is gathered, stored, or assessed by this website.

The website owners are committed to safeguarding user privacy and maintaining transparency regarding data collection practices. Should you have any concerns or queries regarding the privacy of your information or the functioning of this website, please feel free to reach out through the provided contact information.
