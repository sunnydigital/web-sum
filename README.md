# Repository for Web Summarizer Plugin in ChatGPT and Associated Webpage

This repository deals with the planning and hosting of the Web Summarizer Plugin intended for the ChatGPT Plugin Store, with a backend hosted on a Netlify server to interface with ChatGPT. All considered, this is a simple plugin meant as a trial project to get accustomed to the OpenAI ecosystem.

To use this plugin, enter the URL [web-sum.replit.app/](web-sum.replit.app/) under Install an Unverified Plugin given you have the feature unlocked in ChatGPT.

Otherwise, it is possible to use Replit and host your own session by downloading the latest release and following the directions on the release page.

Refer to the [website](https://web-sum.sunnyson.dev/) for more details on installation.

Or, you can simply download the plugin from the ChatGPT plugin store for *free*

Simply search up *Webpage Summarizer* and you're good to go!
